## Configuration Options

### Tracking Depth

**Basic**
- Quick extraction of main events and facts
- Lower token usage
- Best for casual chats or limited API budgets

**Detailed** (Recommended)
- Comprehensive extraction including emotions and relationships
- Balanced token usage
- Best for most roleplay scenarios

**Comprehensive**
- Deep analysis including subtext, contradictions, and character development
- Higher token usage
- Best for complex, long-term stories

### Memory Management

- **Max Memory Entries**: Controls how many memories to keep
  - Older, less important memories are automatically pruned
  - Important memories are always kept regardless of age
  
- **Auto-Injection**: When enabled, relevant memories are automatically added to the context
  - Only the most relevant memories are injected
  - Helps maintain consistency without manual work

### Notifications

When enabled, you'll receive notifications for:
- High-importance events (>70% importance)
- Significant relationship changes
- Important revelations or secrets

## How It Works

### Memory Extraction Process

1. **Message Analysis**: Each message is analyzed using your selected LLM
2. **Information Extraction**: The AI identifies:
   - Key events and facts
   - Emotional context
   - Character development
   - Relationship changes
   - Important revelations
3. **Scoring**: Assigns importance score (0.0 - 1.0)
4. **Storage**: Saves to chat metadata
5. **Context Injection**: Relevant memories are injected into prompts (if enabled)

### Relationship Tracking

- Monitors mentions of relationship dynamics
- Detects positive/negative changes
- Maintains historical record
- Updates relationship level (-1.0 to +1.0)

### Timeline Construction

- Records significant events in chronological order
- Links to specific messages
- Allows navigation through story progression

## Data Storage

All data is stored in your chat's metadata file and persists across sessions:
- Location: `SillyTavern/data/<user>/chats/<chat-name>.jsonl`
- Format: JSON
- Exportable: Use the Export button or `/memory-export` command

## Performance Considerations

### Token Usage

The extension uses tokens for memory extraction:
- **Basic**: ~150-300 tokens per message
- **Detailed**: ~300-500 tokens per message
- **Comprehensive**: ~500-800 tokens per message

These extractions happen in the background using quiet prompts, so they don't interrupt your RP flow.

### Optimization Tips

1. Use Basic tracking for everyday chats
2. Use Detailed for important story moments
3. Use Comprehensive for climactic scenes
4. Lower the max memory entries if you notice slowdowns
5. Disable auto-injection if you prefer manual memory management

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Check that `enableExtensions` is set to `true` in `config.yaml`
- Verify the extension folder is in the correct location
- Check browser console for error messages (F12)

### Memories Not Being Created
- Ensure the extension is enabled in settings
- Check that your API is properly configured
- Verify your API supports JSON schema/structured outputs
- Try increasing tracking depth

### Performance Issues
- Reduce max memory entries
- Lower tracking depth
- Disable auto-injection
- Clear old memories from completed stories

### Memory Panel Not Opening
- Check browser console for errors
- Try reloading the page
- Ensure jQuery is loaded (should be automatic)
