# 🚀 Version 2.0.0 - Edit & Speed Features

## What's New

Two major features added:
1. **✏️ Edit Memories** - Modify any memory after creation
2. **⚡ Speed Optimizations** - 2-5x faster analysis

---

## ✏️ **Edit Memories Feature**

### **How to Edit**

When viewing memories, each one now has two buttons:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Alice] ★★★★☆ anxious  2:30 PM  [✏️][🗑️]│
│ ──────────────────────────────────────── │
│ Revealed childhood trauma about heights  │
│ 💡 Will affect rooftop scenes           │
│ Tags: fear heights childhood trauma     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                   ↑   ↑
                                 Edit Delete
```

**Click the pencil icon (✏️)** to open the edit dialog.

**All fields are editable!**

---

### **What You Can Edit**

| Field | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Summary** | Main description of the memory |
| **Importance** | 0.0 to 1.0 importance score |
| **Emotion** | Emotional context (happy, sad, etc.) |
| **Keywords** | Search tags (comma-separated) |
| **Continuity Note** | Why this matters / future implications |

**Can't edit:**
- Timestamp (when it was created)
- Source (manual, lorebook, range_analysis)
- Character name (if from group chat)
- Message index (which message it came from)

---

### **Common Edit Use Cases**

#### **Use Case 1: Fix AI Mistakes**

```
AI created:
Summary: "Character likes food"
Importance: 0.5
Keywords: food, eating

Your edit:
Summary: "Character has severe food allergies to nuts"
Importance: 0.9
Keywords: allergy, nuts, health, danger, severe
Continuity Note: "MUST be mentioned in any dining scenes"
```

---

#### **Use Case 2: Adjust Importance**

```
AI rated at 0.4, but it's actually crucial:

Before: Character mentioned old friend [★★☆☆☆]
After:  Character mentioned old friend [★★★★★]
```

---

#### **Use Case 3: Add Keywords**

```
Before: Keywords: secret
After:  Keywords: secret, murder, witness, danger, police, hiding
```

Now much easier to find!

---

#### **Use Case 4: Expand Summary**

```
Before: "Alice revealed something"
After:  "Alice revealed she witnessed her father's murder 
         as a child and has been in witness protection"
```

---

#### **Use Case 5: Add Continuity Notes**

```
Before: No continuity note
After:  "This is why she avoids cameras and uses fake names.
         Should come up if photos are mentioned."
```

---

### **Tips for Editing**

✅ **Do:**
- Fix obvious AI errors
- Adjust importance for plot-critical info
- Add keywords you'll remember
- Add continuity notes for future reference
- Consolidate duplicate memories

❌ **Don't:**
- Edit every memory obsessively
- Make summaries too long
- Add unrelated keywords
- Change meaning completely (just delete and re-add)

---

## ⚡ **Speed Optimization Features**

### **New Settings**

In extension settings, new "Performance Optimization" section:

```
⚡ Performance Optimization

Batch Size: 5 [====    ] 10
└─ Process N messages in parallel

☐ Skip low-importance messages  
└─ Don't save memories below threshold

Importance Threshold: 0.3 [==      ] 0.8
└─ Only save memories above this level
```

---

### **1. Batch Size (Parallel Processing)**

**What it does:**
- Processes multiple messages simultaneously
- Instead of one-by-one, does N at once

**Speed Impact:**

| Batch Size | Speed | Safety |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Slowest | Safest |
| 3 | 2x faster | Safe |
| 5 (default) | 3x faster | Recommended |
| 7 | 4x faster | Aggressive |
| 10 | 5x faster | May hit rate limits |

**Recommendation:**
- OpenAI: 5-7
- Claude: 5
- Local models: 3
- Free tier APIs: 1-3

**Example:**
```
100 messages to analyze:

Batch 1: 1 message per batch
= 100 batches
= ~200 seconds (3+ minutes)

Batch 5: 5 messages per batch  
= 20 batches
= ~60 seconds (1 minute)

Batch 10: 10 messages per batch
= 10 batches
= ~35 seconds
```

---

### **2. Skip Low-Importance**

**What it does:**
- AI still analyzes each message
- But doesn't save if importance < threshold
- Saves only significant memories

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster analysis (less saving)
- ✅ Cleaner memory list
- ✅ Only important stuff
- ✅ Less clutter

**When to use:**
```
✅ Analyzing 200+ messages
✅ Lots of casual chat
✅ Want only key moments
✅ Memory limit concerns

❌ Short conversations
❌ Every message matters
❌ Want complete record
```

---

### **3. Importance Threshold**

**What it means:**

| Threshold | What Gets Saved |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0.1 | Almost everything |
| 0.3 (default) | Meaningful moments |
| 0.5 | Notable events |
| 0.7 | Significant only |
| 0.9 | Critical plot points |

**Example at 0.5:**
```
✅ Saved (≥0.5):
- Character reveals secret (0.9)
- Major decision made (0.8)
- Important question asked (0.7)
- Emotional moment (0.6)
- Character detail shared (0.5)

❌ Skipped (<0.5):
- "How are you?" (0.2)
- Weather comment (0.3)
- Filler dialogue (0.4)
```

---

### **Speed Comparison**

#### **Analyzing 100 Messages**

**v1.x (Old):**
```
Process: Sequential (one by one)
Speed: ~2 seconds per message
Total: 200 seconds (3.3 minutes)
```

**v2.0 (Default - Batch 5):**
```
Process: Parallel batches of 5
Speed: ~2 seconds per batch
Total: ~40-60 seconds (< 1 minute)

🚀 3-4x faster!
```

**v2.0 (Aggressive - Batch 10 + Skip):**
```
Process: Parallel batches of 10
Skip: Low importance (<0.5)
Total: ~20-30 seconds

🚀 6-8x faster!
```

---

### **Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Balanced** (Recommended)
```
Batch Size: 5
Skip Low Importance: OFF
Threshold: N/A

Result:
- Good speed (3x faster)
- All memories saved
- Safe for all APIs
```

---

#### **Strategy 2: Fast**
```
Batch Size: 7
Skip Low Importance: ON
Threshold: 0.4

Result:
- Very fast (5x faster)
- Only meaningful memories
- May hit rate limits with free APIs
```

---

#### **Strategy 3: Ultra Fast**
```
Batch Size: 10
Skip Low Importance: ON
Threshold: 0.5

Result:
- Extremely fast (6-8x faster)
- Only important memories
- Risk of rate limiting
```

---

#### **Strategy 4: Safe**
```
Batch Size: 1
Skip Low Importance: OFF
Threshold: N/A

Result:
- Slowest
- All memories saved
- No rate limit risk
- Use for free/limited APIs
```

---

### **API-Specific Recommendations**

#### **OpenAI (Paid)**
```
Batch Size: 7
Skip: Optional
Threshold: 0.4 (if skipping)

Why: High rate limits, good parallel support
```

---

#### **Claude (Anthropic)**
```
Batch Size: 5
Skip: Optional  
Threshold: 0.3 (if skipping)

Why: Good rate limits, excellent quality
```

---

#### **Local Models**
```
Batch Size: 3
Skip: OFF
Threshold: N/A

Why: Slower generation, parallel helps less
```

---

#### **Free Tier / Limited APIs**
```
Batch Size: 1-2
Skip: OFF
Threshold: N/A

Why: Low rate limits, avoid parallel
```

---

### **Rate Limiting**

**What happens if you hit rate limits:**
```
Symptoms:
- "Too many requests" errors
- Analysis stops partway
- Some memories missing

Solutions:
1. Lower batch size (7 → 5 → 3)
2. Increase delay (100ms → 500ms)
3. Try again in a few minutes
4. Use lower settings
```

---

## 🎯 **Using Both Features Together**

### **Workflow 1: Fast Initial Analysis**

```
Step 1: Analyze with fast settings
- Batch: 10
- Skip: ON (threshold 0.5)
- Result: Only key moments, very fast

Step 2: Review memories
- Check what was captured
- Identify any gaps

Step 3: Fill gaps manually
- Add manual memories for missed items
- Or re-analyze specific ranges

Step 4: Edit as needed
- Fix any AI mistakes
- Adjust importance
- Add continuity notes
```

---

### **Workflow 2: Complete Then Clean**

```
Step 1: Analyze with complete settings
- Batch: 5
- Skip: OFF
- Result: All memories, good speed

Step 2: Review and edit
- Check all memories
- Edit mistakes
- Adjust importance

Step 3: Delete junk
- Remove unimportant ones
- Keep only meaningful
- Manual curation
```

---

### **Workflow 3: Iterative Refinement**

```
Step 1: Fast pass (Batch 10, Skip ON @ 0.6)
Step 2: Review what's captured
Step 3: Second pass on missed ranges (Batch 5, Skip OFF)
Step 4: Edit all memories
Step 5: Final cleanup
```
