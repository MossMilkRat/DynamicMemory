# Using Dynamic Memory Tracker with Existing Chats

## üîÑ The Challenge

You've been having an amazing RP session for hours/days/weeks, and now you want to add memory tracking. But how does the extension understand everything that's already happened?

## ‚ú® The Solution: Catch-Up Analysis

The extension includes a **"Analyze Existing Chat"** feature that retroactively processes your entire chat history to build a complete memory profile.

---

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install & Enable
1. Install the extension (see INSTALL.md)
2. Enable it in the Extensions panel
3. Configure your preferred settings

### Step 2: Analyze Your Chat
1. Open your existing chat
2. Click the **"Analyze Existing Chat"** button in the extension settings
3. Review the confirmation dialog (it tells you how many messages will be processed)
4. Click "OK" to start

### Step 3: Wait for Analysis
- The extension will process all messages sequentially
- A progress bar shows how many messages have been analyzed
- For a 100-message chat, expect 3-5 minutes
- You can continue chatting; new messages are tracked automatically

### Step 4: Review Results
- Click "View Memories" to see what was extracted
- Check "View Relationships" to see the relationship dynamics
- Browse the "Timeline" to see story progression
- Filter and search as needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### What Gets Analyzed

For each message, the AI extracts:

**üìù Basic Info**
- Summary of main events
- Importance score (0.0 - 1.0)
- Emotional tone

**üí≠ Detailed Analysis** (if enabled)
- Character feelings and thoughts
- Relationship dynamics
- Important revelations
- Continuity notes

**üîç Comprehensive Analysis** (if enabled)
- Character development
- Subtext and implications
- Potential contradictions
- Story arcs

### Processing Flow

```
1. Load all messages from chat
2. For each message:
   ‚Üì
3. Check if already analyzed (skip if yes)
   ‚Üì
4. Send to AI for analysis
   ‚Üì
5. Extract structured memory data
   ‚Üì
6. Store in chat metadata
   ‚Üì
7. Update relationships & timeline
   ‚Üì
8. Save to disk

9. Trim to max memories (keeps most important)
10. Show completion summary
```

### Smart Batching

- Processes 5 messages at a time
- Small delays between batches (avoids API rate limits)
- Skips already-analyzed messages (safe to re-run)
- Saves progress periodically

## üí° Best Practices

### Before Analysis

**1. Choose the Right Tracking Depth**

- **Basic**: Fast, lightweight
  - Good for: Casual chats, budget constraints
  - Time: ~30 seconds per 100 messages
  
- **Detailed**: Balanced (Recommended)
  - Good for: Most RP scenarios
  - Time: ~3-5 minutes per 100 messages
  
- **Comprehensive**: Deep analysis
  - Good for: Complex plots, long-term stories
  - Time: ~8-12 minutes per 100 messages

**2. Set Appropriate Memory Limits**

- For short chats (< 50 messages): 25-30 memories
- For medium chats (50-200 messages): 50 memories
- For long chats (200+ messages): 75-100 memories

**3. Consider Your API**

- **OpenAI/Claude**: All tracking depths work great
- **Local models**: Stick to Basic or Detailed
- **Budget concerns**: Start with Basic, upgrade as needed

### During Analysis

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Let it run in the background
- ‚úÖ Continue chatting (new messages tracked separately)
- ‚úÖ Check progress occasionally
- ‚úÖ Be patient with long chats

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Close the browser tab
- ‚ùå Switch chats mid-analysis
- ‚ùå Disable the extension
- ‚ùå Spam the analyze button

### After Analysis

**Review & Refine:**
1. Browse the memories - are they accurate?
2. Check relationships - do they reflect the story?
3. View timeline - does it capture key moments?
4. Export data (backup your memories!)

**If Results Are Poor:**
- Try a higher tracking depth
- Check your AI model supports structured outputs
- Verify your prompts are clear
- Re-run analysis after adjustments

## üìä What to Expect

### Memory Quality

**High Importance (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ)**
- Major revelations
- Significant emotional moments
- Relationship milestones
- Plot-critical events

**Medium Importance (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ)**
- Character development moments
- Meaningful conversations
- Minor conflicts resolved
- Setting details

**Low Importance (‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ)**
- Small talk
- Routine actions
- Background details
- Transitional moments

### Typical Results

**For a 100-message romance RP:**
- 40-60 memories extracted
- 5-8 relationship types tracked
- 30-45 timeline events
- 10-15 high-importance moments

**For a 50-message adventure RP:**
- 20-30 memories extracted
- 3-5 relationship types tracked
- 15-25 timeline events
- 5-8 high-importance moments

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Analysis Stuck or Slow

**Problem**: Progress bar not moving
**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify API is responding (test with regular chat)
- Try lowering tracking depth
- Process chat in smaller sections (see Advanced Tips)

### Poor Quality Memories

**Problem**: Extracted memories don't make sense
**Solutions**:
- Increase tracking depth
- Check your API model (some models work better than others)
- Verify JSON schema support in your API
- Try a different AI model/service

### Duplicate Memories

**Problem**: Same event appears multiple times
**Solutions**:
- Click "Analyze Existing Chat" only once
- Extension automatically skips re-analyzed messages
- If duplicates exist, export ‚Üí edit JSON ‚Üí re-import

### Out of Memory / Browser Crash

**Problem**: Browser slows down or crashes
**Solutions**:
- Lower max memory entries
- Use Basic tracking depth
- Process chat in sections (see Advanced Tips)
- Close other browser tabs

## üéì Advanced Tips

### Processing Long Chats in Sections

For very long chats (500+ messages):

1. **Export your chat** (backup first!)
2. **Split into sections**:
   - Create temporary chat with first 200 messages
   - Analyze
   - Export memories
   - Repeat for next section
3. **Merge results** manually if needed

### Manual Memory Editing

You can edit memories directly:

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
const ctx = SillyTavern.getContext();
const memories = ctx.chatMetadata.memoryTracker.memories;

// Find and edit a memory
const memory = memories.find(m => m.summary.includes('your search term'));
memory.summary = "Your updated summary";
memory.importance = 0.95; // Update importance

// Save changes
await ctx.saveMetadata();
```

### Selective Re-Analysis

To re-analyze only recent messages:

1. Export current memories (backup)
2. Delete memories from a specific message index onwards
3. Run analysis (it will only process messages without memories)

### Combining with World Info

For best results:
1. Enable World Info entries for key facts
2. Use Memory Tracker for dynamic events
3. World Info = static facts (character backgrounds, lore)
4. Memory Tracker = dynamic narrative (what happened, how relationships changed)

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will this analyze every message, even small talk?**
A: Yes, but small talk typically gets low importance scores and may be trimmed to make room for important memories.

**Q: How much does this cost in API tokens?**
A: Approximately 150-800 tokens per message depending on tracking depth. For a 100-message chat: 15k-80k tokens.

**Q: Can I stop analysis mid-way?**
A: Technically yes (refresh page), but you'll lose progress. Better to let it finish.

**Q: Will this work with group chats?**
A: Yes, but the extension doesn't currently distinguish between different characters in the group. It tracks all as general chat memories.

**Q: Can I analyze multiple chats at once?**
A: No, analyze one chat at a time. Switch chats and run analysis again.

**Q: What if I add more messages later?**
A: The extension auto-tracks new messages. You only need to run analysis once for existing messages.

**Q: Can I customize what gets extracted?**
A: Not directly through UI, but you can modify the extraction prompts in `index.js` for full control.

## üöÄ Next Steps

Now that your chat is analyzed:

1. **Enable Auto-Injection** for seamless memory integration
2. **Set up notifications** for important moments
3. **Regularly export** your data for backup
4. **Browse memories** before major story beats
5. **Enjoy** more consistent, emotionally aware RP!

---

## üíæ Data Location

Your analyzed memories are stored in:
```
SillyTavern/data/<user>/chats/<chat-name>.jsonl
```

In the chat metadata, under:
```javascript
chatMetadata.memoryTracker = {
  memories: [...],
  relationships: {...},
  timeline: [...],
  emotionalStates: {...}
}
```

Always **export** before making major changes!
