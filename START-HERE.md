## 🎯 What This Does

In simple terms:

**Before:** AI forgets important story moments. Characters act inconsistently. You have to manually remind the AI about past events.

**After:** AI remembers significant moments. Relationship dynamics are tracked. Characters reference past events naturally. Timeline keeps story straight.

---

## 🚀 The Magic Button

If you have an ongoing chat, there's ONE button that does everything:

**"Analyze Existing Chat"** 
- Processes all your messages
- Extracts important memories
- Builds relationship history  
- Creates timeline
- Takes 3-10 minutes
- **You only do this ONCE**

After that, new messages are tracked automatically!

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Use "Detailed" tracking (balanced)
- Enable auto-injection
- Export data regularly (backups!)
- Check memories before big scenes

❌ **DON'T:**
